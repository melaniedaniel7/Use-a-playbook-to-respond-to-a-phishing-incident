In this activity, I responded to a phishing incident that involved a malicious file hash. I then followed a playbook's instructions to investigate and resolve the incident's alert ticket.

Previously, I learned how playbooks outline the step-by-step actions necessary to properly respond to a security incident. Coordinated, effective, and quick action is critical during incident response. A playbook can help security teams minimize the impact of an incident and reduce the incident response time. As a security analyst, playbooks can help guide one to effectively support an organization's incident response efforts.
